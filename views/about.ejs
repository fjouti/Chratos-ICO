                    <p class="about-content">CHRATOS is a (crypto)currency that gives the world a passive income by investing in advancements for humanity through blockchain technology.<br/>
                        Holders of the currency will receive an automatic 31.5576% annual interest rate through a Proof­of­Stake algorithm. This interest rate is split up in seconds, which means you will get paid exactly 0.00000001 CHR every second.<br/>
                        Annual interest rates will be halved at 50%, 75% and 87,5% of the maximum amount being reached and will eventually consist of transaction fees when the maximum amount of 1,000,000,000 CHRATOS is reached. It should take ~22+ years before the first reward halving.<br/>
                        CHRATOS functions as an autonomous, decentralized dividend fund. All the funds generated during its crowdsale, from its commissions and and through its investments will be invested into public “Dividend Smart Contracts”.<br/>
                        These “Dividend Smart Contracts” will be signed with third party companies that will generate revenue for its currency­holders. CHRATOS will ALWAYS receive dividends in CHRATOS to ensure money flowing back into the currency. All Dividend Smart Contracts are public.
